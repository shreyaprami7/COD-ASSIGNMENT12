# IS2101-ArithmeticOps--NNM24IS194-
To implement signed integer multiplication and division algorithms using C programming
This repository contains C programs implementing three fundamental arithmetic algorithms:
1.)Sequential (Shift-Add) Multiplication
Supports signed integers using 2â€™s complement.
Shows step-by-step shift and add logic.

2.)Restoring Division Algorithm
Works with positive integers.

3.)Non-Restoring Division Algorithm

Similar to restoring division but with non-restoring logic.
Trace output of each step (accumulator,dividend,quotient bits).
These programs simulate how arithmetic operations are performed at the hardware level. It lets you get handson experience on how hardware level calculation work and how you can improvise the time complexity by minimizing the steps (for ex: restoring to non restoring division algorithm).
